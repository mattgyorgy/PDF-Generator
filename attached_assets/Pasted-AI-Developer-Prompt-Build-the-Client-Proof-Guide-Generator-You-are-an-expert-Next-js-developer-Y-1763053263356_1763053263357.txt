AI Developer Prompt: Build the "Client-Proof" Guide Generator
You are an expert Next.js developer. Your task is to build a complete, production-ready lead magnet application hosted on Vercel.

1. Project Goal
Build a 1-page web application called the "Client-Proof" Filming Guide Generator.

The flow is as follows:

A user (a Social Media Manager) lands on the page.

They immediately see a 2-panel layout: a "Generator Tool" on the left and a "Live Preview" of a PDF on the right.

The user enters their company name, uploads their logo, and picks a brand color.

The "Live Preview" on the right updates in real-time as they type.

When the user is happy, they click "Generate My Guide."

A "Conversion Modal" (popup) appears, asking for their email to download the guide they just created.

After submitting their email, a backend API route is triggered.

The API route generates the custom-branded PDF on the server, attaches it to an email, and sends it to the user via Resend.

The modal shows a "Success" message.

2. Core Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

PDF Generation: @react-pdf/renderer

Email Service: Resend

Icons: Google Material Icons (use @mui/icons-material for the easiest React integration)

State Management: React useState and useContext (for sharing generator state with the preview).

Hosting: Vercel

3. Implementation Plan
Step 1: Project Setup
Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Install the required dependencies:

Bash

npm install @react-pdf/renderer resend react-dom @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
Step 2: State Management (Context)
Create a context to hold the generator's state.

app/context/GeneratorContext.tsx:

Create a context GeneratorContext that provides:

companyName: string

setCompanyName: (name: string) => void

brandColor: string

setBrandColor: (color: string) => void

logo: File | null

setLogo: (file: File | null) => void

logoPreviewUrl: string | null (Generate this using URL.createObjectURL(logo))

Step 3: Main Page Layout (The 2-Panel UI)
app/page.tsx:

Wrap the page in the GeneratorContextProvider.

Create a 2-panel responsive layout (stack on mobile, flex-row on desktop).

Left Panel (The Tool): <GeneratorTool />

Right Panel (The Preview): <LivePreview />

Step 4: Left Panel (<GeneratorTool />)
app/components/GeneratorTool.tsx:

Use the useContext(GeneratorContext).

Headline: "Create Your FREE Custom-Branded Filming Guide"

Sub-headline: "Stop getting "bad" video from clients. Create a 1-page guide with your logo and brand color to send to every new client."

Component 1: Name Input:

A Tailwind-styled <input type="text"> for "Your Company Name".

onChange updates setCompanyName.

Component 2: Color Picker:

Use 5-6 pre-set Tailwind color swatches (e.g., bg-blue-500, bg-green-500, bg-red-500) that onClick update setBrandColor.

Also include an <input type="color"> for full customization.

Component 3: Logo Uploader:

An <input type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg">.

onChange, set the logo and generate the logoPreviewUrl.

Component 4: The CTA Button:

A large button: "Generate My Guide".

onClick, it will open the <ConversionModal />.

Step 5: Right Panel (<LivePreview />)
app/components/LivePreview.tsx:

Use the useContext(GeneratorContext).

This component simulates the PDF. It should look like a A4 document.

Create a white div with a box-shadow and a 4:5.6 aspect ratio.

Re-build the PDF layout (from Step 7) using simple HTML and Tailwind.

The companyName text should update as the user types.

The logoPreviewUrl should be used in an <img> tag.

The headlines and icons should have their color set by the brandColor state.

Step 6: The Modal (<ConversionModal />)
app/components/ConversionModal.tsx:

A modal that is shown/hidden by a state variable.

It contains an <form> with one field: [Email Address] and a button: [Send My PDF].

When the form is submitted, it does three things:

Shows a "loading/generation" animation (Building your PDF..., Sending...).

Uses FormData to get the email, companyName, brandColor, and logo file.

POSTs this FormData to our API route: /api/generate.

On a successful response, show a "Success! Check your inbox." message.

On error, show an error message.

Step 7: The Actual PDF Document
app/components/PdfDocument.tsx:

This is the most critical component. It uses @react-pdf/renderer.

It must be rendered on the server in the API route.

Do not import this component on the client-side.

It will accept props: companyName, brandColor, logoImageUrl.

Use the @react-pdf/renderer components: <Document>, <Page>, <View>, <Text>, <Image>, <StyleSheet>.

Layout:

<Page style={styles.page}>

<View style={styles.header}>

<Image src={logoImageUrl} style={styles.logo} />

<Text style={styles.mainHeadline}>How to Film Pro-Quality Video on Your Phone</Text>

<Text style={styles.subHeadline}>A 5-step guide from your friends at {companyName}</Text>

</View>

<View style={styles.rulesContainer}>

(Rule 1) <View style={styles.rule}>

{/* Use an <Image> for the icon, or render SVG as text */}

<Text style={styles.ruleTitle}>1. LIGHT: Face a Window</Text>

<Text style={styles.ruleText}>Do: Your best light is free. Set up your phone and *then* face the nearest window.</Text>

</View>

(Rules 2, 3, 4, 5) ... (Repeat for all 5 rules)

</View>

<Text style={styles.footer}>Powered by Hero</Text>

Styling (in StyleSheet.create(...)):

mainHeadline and ruleTitle should use the brandColor prop.

Step 8: The Backend API Route
app/api/generate/route.ts:

This is the POST function that does all the work.

1. Parse FormData: Get the email, companyName, brandColor, and logo file.

2. Upload Logo: We need a public URL for the PDF's Image tag. A simple way is to upload the logo to Vercel Blob. (You will need to set this up). Get the publicUrl back.

3. Generate PDF:

Import ReactPDF.renderToStream from @react-pdf/renderer.

Import PdfDocument from app/components/PdfDocument.tsx.

const pdfStream = await ReactPDF.renderToStream(<PdfDocument companyName={companyName} brandColor={brandColor} logoImageUrl={publicUrl} />);

4. Buffer the PDF: We need to convert the stream to a buffer to send with Resend.

5. Send Email:

Initialize Resend: const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

await resend.emails.send({ ... });

from: "Hero you@yourdomain.com"

to: [email]

subject: "Here's your Custom-Branded Filming Guide!"

react: <YourEmailTemplate /> (A simple "Here is your guide!" email)

attachments: [{ filename: 'Your_Filming_Guide.pdf', content: pdfBuffer }]

6. Return Response:

If successful, return NextResponse.json({ status: 'ok' }, { status: 200 }).

If failed, return an error.

Step 9: PDF Content (For copy-pasting)
Use these icons from @mui/icons-material:

LIGHT: <WbSunny />

SOUND: <GraphicEq /> or <Mic />

FRAME: <StayCurrentLandscape /> or <CropRotate />

CLEAN: <CleanHands /> or <HdrWeak />

SEND: <UploadFile /> or <CloudUpload />

PDF Text:

Headline: How to Film Pro-Quality Video on Your Phone

Sub-headline: A 5-step guide from your friends at [Company Name]

Rule 1:

LIGHT: Face a Window

Do: Your best light is free. Set up your phone and then face the nearest window.

Don't: Never film with a window behind you.

Rule 2:

SOUND: Find a Quiet Room

Do: A small room with a rug or curtains is perfect (even a closet!).

Don't: Avoid big, empty rooms like kitchens or garages (they echo!).

Rule 3:

FRAME: Prop Your Phone Up

Do: Film horizontally (turn your phone sideways!). Prop it on a stack of books and look at the camera lens, not at your own face on the screen.

Don't: Never film holding the phone in your hand (it's shaky).

Rule 4:

CLEAN: Wipe Your Lens

Do: Your phone lens is dirty. Use your t-shirt or a soft cloth to wipe the front and back camera lenses.

Don't: A blurry video is usually just a smudged lens!

Rule 5:

SEND: Use the Special Link

Do: Use the secure upload link I've provided. This sends the full, original, high-quality file.

Don't: Never text or email the video. (Those services shrink and ruin your file!)
